## Amsterdam Enforcement: Mammoet Triumphs Over Iraq’s BOC

In February 2025, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Dutch company Mammoet Salvage B.V., enforcing an ICC arbitral award against Iraq’s state-owned Basra Oil Company (BOC). The decision—arising from a long-running wreck-removal dispute—clarified how sovereign immunity, public policy, and the limits of judicial review operate under the **New York Convention**. It reinforced that state-linked debtors are not immune from the enforcement of commercial arbitration awards in Europe (Global Arbitration Review, 2025).

## The Contract and Arbitration

Mammoet and BOC entered into a contract in 2013 to remove a sunken vessel from Iraq’s territorial waters. The contract included an arbitration clause designating the **ICC** and **DIFC** as the arbitration seat. However, the relationship deteriorated following delays, alleged military interference by the Iraqi Navy, and payment disputes. Mammoet suspended operations and commenced ICC arbitration in 2018.

In 2021, the ICC tribunal issued a final award. It ordered BOC to pay Mammoet approximately **US $85 million**, offset by a **US $37 million** deduction due to BOC’s partial counterclaim—bringing the net award to nearly US $48 million (Daily Jus, 2025).

## Jurisdictional Fight: Dubai and Beyond

BOC initially tried to annul the award in the **Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)** courts but failed. The DIFC Court of Appeal rejected its challenge in January 2025, holding that the tribunal had acted within its mandate and the award complied with the parties’ agreement (Jus Mundi, 2025).

Mammoet then sought enforcement in the Netherlands, a jurisdiction where BOC allegedly held commercial assets.

## Enforcement and Objections in the Netherlands

On **11 February 2025**, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal considered three key objections raised by BOC:

### 1. **Excess of Jurisdiction**
BOC argued that the ICC tribunal ruled on issues beyond its scope—particularly regarding military actions by the Iraqi Navy. The Court rejected this. It found that the arbitration focused on BOC’s contractual breaches, not acts of state (Global Arbitration Review, 2025).

### 2. **Public Policy**
BOC claimed the award violated Dutch public policy due to alleged bribery and procedural irregularities. The Court emphasized that:
- These claims had been fully addressed by the tribunal.
- BOC had actually received partial relief via counterclaims.
- There was no evidence of fundamental unfairness warranting non-enforcement (Daily Jus, 2025).

### 3. **Sovereign Immunity**
BOC invoked sovereign immunity under international law. The Court dismissed this by applying the **restrictive theory**: BOC acted in a **commercial capacity (jure gestionis)**, not in the exercise of sovereign authority (jure imperii). Consequently, immunity did not apply (Slaughter & May, 2025).

## Enforcement Under the New York Convention

The Court’s reasoning aligned closely with **Article V** of the **New York Convention (1958)**, which outlines the only grounds on which a court may refuse enforcement of a foreign arbitral award. These include:

- Invalid arbitration agreement (Art. V(1)(a))  
- Lack of notice or unfair hearing (Art. V(1)(b))  
- Award exceeds the scope of submission (Art. V(1)(c))  
- Improper composition of tribunal (Art. V(1)(d))  
- Award is not binding or has been annulled (Art. V(1)(e))  
- Public policy violation (Art. V(2)(b))  

Notably, courts may not review **errors of law or fact**—only threshold procedural and jurisdictional breaches. The Amsterdam Court reaffirmed this doctrine, noting that none of BOC’s arguments satisfied Article V thresholds (Guide to NY Convention, 2023).

## Key Lesson: Sovereign Immunity and Commercial Acts

The judgment reiterates that **state-owned enterprises** are subject to arbitration enforcement when acting commercially. This applies regardless of political sensitivity. BOC’s status as a national oil company did not insulate it from obligations freely undertaken under an international contract.

---

## Public Policy: A Narrow Gateway

The case further narrows the use of public policy exceptions. Courts will not entertain speculative or weakly evidenced claims. Public policy defences require violations of **fundamental fairness**, not tactical complaints post-award (Mondaq, 2024).

---

## Why This Case Matters

- **Investor Certainty**: It sends a strong message to contractors and foreign investors: arbitral awards can be enforced against state-linked parties in European jurisdictions.

- **Judicial Restraint**: It affirms courts' limited review powers under the New York Convention—maintaining arbitral finality and predictability.

- **Rule-of-Law in Action**: The ruling is a victory for international legal frameworks that prioritise commercial justice over geopolitical protectionism.

## Conclusion

Mammoet v BOC is more than a salvage dispute—it is a case about how international law disciplines sovereign-linked entities. It confirms that when states and SOEs enter commercial contracts, they are bound by their agreements and subject to international enforcement mechanisms. Under the New York Convention, the path from arbitration award to court order is not always easy—but in rule-of-law jurisdictions like the Netherlands, it remains reliably open.
