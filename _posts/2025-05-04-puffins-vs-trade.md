## Puffins vs Trade: How a Tiny Fish Triggered the First Brexit Arbitration

In 2024, the UK banned fishing for sand-eels — a slender forage fish critical to the diet of seabirds like puffins and kittiwakes. The decision, framed as an urgent step to protect marine biodiversity, quickly turned into a major international legal dispute. That’s because under the **EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)** — signed in the wake of Brexit — EU fishing vessels were still entitled to access certain UK waters until 2026.

This culminated in a **landmark case** concluded by the **Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)** on 28 April 2025, marking the first formal arbitration under the post-Brexit trade framework.

## Background: Why the UK Banned Sand-Eel Fishing

In March 2024, the UK government, supported by devolved administrations, announced a permanent closure of sand-eel fisheries in both English and Scottish waters. The rationale was ecological: sand-eels are a crucial prey species for seabirds whose populations are declining sharply due to overfishing and climate change. The decision followed scientific assessments suggesting that sand-eel populations had become dangerously low in key areas (Marine Management Organisation, 2024).

However, under Annex 38 of the TCA, the EU — and especially Denmark, whose vessels rely heavily on sand-eel fisheries — retained access rights to those waters during a transition period (European Commission, 2024). The EU argued that the UK had implemented the ban without adequate consultation, failed to properly justify the measure, and thereby breached its treaty obligations.

When diplomatic talks failed, the EU invoked the TCA’s dispute settlement mechanism and referred the case to arbitration in October 2024 (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2025a).

## The Legal Issues: Environmental Protection Meets Trade Law

The tribunal had to consider four central legal questions under the TCA:

1. Was the UK’s ban based on the best available scientific advice?  
2. Did the ban discriminate against EU vessels?  
3. Was the measure proportionate, balancing conservation goals with EU fishing rights?  
4. Did the ban breach the EU’s access rights under Annex 38 of the TCA?

Both parties submitted extensive written arguments, presented evidence at hearings in January 2025, and engaged in procedural review before the tribunal issued its Final Award on 28 April (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2025b).

## The Verdict: A Split Decision

The tribunal’s ruling was mixed but significant:

- The UK succeeded on two major points. The tribunal found the ban was based on credible scientific evidence and applied equally to UK and EU vessels (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2025b, pp. 120–140). There was no discrimination or disregard for science (pp. 140–160).

- However, the UK partially failed on proportionality. The tribunal concluded that while the Scottish ban was lawful and proportionate, the English ban had not been adequately justified. The UK had failed to fully consider the impact on EU access rights and had not demonstrated why less restrictive alternatives were unavailable (pp. 128–136).

As a result, the UK was found to have breached the TCA — but only in respect to English waters. It was ordered to revisit its legal justification and consult accordingly (pp. 148–152).

Importantly, the tribunal did not require the UK to reverse the ban, but made clear that procedural safeguards under the TCA must be upheld (pp. 742–743).

## Why This Case Matters

### 1. First Legal Test of the Brexit Trade Agreement

This was the first formal arbitration under the TCA, marking a turning point in how post-Brexit trade and environmental rules are enforced. It demonstrated that the agreement’s legal mechanisms — including consultation, evidence review, and tribunal-led enforcement — are not just symbolic, but functional.

### 2. A Precedent for Environmental Regulation

The ruling shows that countries can pursue ambitious conservation goals under trade agreements, provided those measures are:
- Science-based  
- Non-discriminatory  
- Proportionate  
- Properly consulted on with affected parties  

The tribunal effectively endorsed environmental action, but also drew a line between environmental ambition and legal process.

### 3. Diplomacy Through Law, Not Escalation

Unlike previous Brexit-era disputes that triggered media storms and diplomatic strain, this case unfolded entirely through formal legal channels. Both the UK and EU accepted the ruling, indicating a maturing relationship that can withstand — and resolve — disagreements within structured legal boundaries.

## What Happens Next?

The Scottish sand-eel ban stands. The English ban remains in place for now, but must be reviewed to meet the proportionality test. The UK has committed to adjusting its legal process without lifting the ban (UK Government, 2025).

Meanwhile, conservation groups have cautiously welcomed the ruling. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) stated that the tribunal “affirmed the importance of science-led decisions to protect our seabirds,” while reminding policymakers that legal robustness must accompany environmental urgency (The Guardian, 2025).

## Conclusion: A Small Fish with Big Implications

This case wasn’t just about fish. It was about how Brexit trade rules, sovereign decision-making, and environmental responsibilities intersect in practice. It showed that legal process matters — even when the policy itself is well-intentioned and widely supported.

As more countries seek to address biodiversity loss and climate risks through regulation, this case may serve as a blueprint for how to do so within international legal frameworks — especially when economic interests are at stake.

The puffins may not have read the ruling. But thanks to this tribunal, the legal system now speaks their language — at least, when it counts.
