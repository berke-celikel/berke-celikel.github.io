## Commercial Deals Under Pressure: ČEZ’s ICC Win Against Gazprom

In February 2025, Czech energy company **ČEZ** secured a major legal victory at the **International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)**, winning over **€42 million** in damages from Russian gas supplier **Gazprom Export**. The dispute stemmed from **Gazprom’s failure to deliver contracted gas volumes during the 2022–23 European energy crisis**, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent EU sanctions.

The case is notable not only for its financial outcome, but also for how it tested the **scope of force majeure in commercial contracts**, particularly when geopolitical conflict disrupts long-term obligations. It’s one of the **few successful arbitrations brought by a European buyer against Gazprom** since the start of the war, and it sheds light on the role of international arbitration when diplomacy fails.

## Background: A Contract in Crisis

ČEZ, a majority state-owned Czech utility, had a **long-standing gas supply agreement** with **Gazprom Export**, a subsidiary of Russian energy giant Gazprom. Under the contract, Gazprom was obligated to deliver specific volumes of natural gas to ČEZ, a critical part of the Czech Republic’s energy supply strategy.

However, in **2022 and 2023**, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, energy flows across Europe were severely disrupted. Gazprom failed to deliver the agreed quantities, citing **extraordinary circumstances** related to the war and EU sanctions. ČEZ, having already paid for significant volumes, was left scrambling for alternatives on a volatile spot market — incurring **major losses**.

When bilateral negotiations failed, ČEZ initiated arbitration at the **ICC International Court of Arbitration**, seeking to recover damages for Gazprom’s non-performance.

## Legal Battle: Force Majeure Under the Microscope

The heart of the legal dispute was **Gazprom’s invocation of force majeure** — a contractual clause that relieves a party from liability when extraordinary events make performance impossible.

Force majeure clauses are common in energy contracts, but **invoking them successfully requires meeting strict conditions**. Most clauses demand that the event:

1. Falls within a defined list (e.g., war, sanctions, natural disasters);  
2. **Directly prevents** performance — not just makes it harder or more expensive;  
3. Cannot be reasonably overcome through alternative means;  
4. Is promptly and transparently notified to the counterparty.

Gazprom claimed that Western sanctions and the geopolitical situation made it impossible to fulfil its delivery obligations. However, ČEZ challenged this defense, arguing that:

- Gazprom did not prove that it was **legally or physically prevented** from delivering gas;  
- The company failed to **mitigate** the disruption or explore reasonable alternatives;  
- It delayed in providing proper **notification and evidence** to support its claim.

## The Ruling: Commercial Risk Is Not Force Majeure

The arbitral tribunal **rejected Gazprom’s force majeure defense**, finding that:

- While war and sanctions can constitute force majeure in principle, **Gazprom failed to show a direct causal link** between these events and its inability to perform.  
- The sanctions regime in place **did not legally prohibit** Gazprom from fulfilling its contractual duties in this specific case.  
- The disruption, although severe, was **foreseeable and potentially manageable**, especially for a state-backed supplier experienced in navigating geopolitical risk.

Instead, the tribunal found that **Gazprom had breached the contract**, and awarded **€42.2 million in damages** to ČEZ, covering prepaid volumes and associated losses (ICC Arbitration, 2025).

This decision marked a rare legal setback for Gazprom in international proceedings, as most similar disputes have either been settled confidentially or withdrawn due to political pressure.

## Why It Matters

### 1. Clarifies the Boundaries of Force Majeure

This case offers a timely clarification: **force majeure is not a free pass**. Even in times of war or sanctions, companies must show that performance was **truly impossible**, not merely burdensome or undesirable. The tribunal sent a strong message — **commercial risk remains commercial risk**, even during crisis.

### 2. Reinforces the Role of Arbitration in Geopolitical Conflicts

When diplomatic or political channels break down, international arbitration provides a neutral forum to enforce rights. This ruling demonstrates that **contractual commitments endure** even in the shadow of geopolitical rupture. It’s a victory not just for ČEZ, but for the rule of law in international commerce.

### 3. A Rare European Win Against Gazprom

Since 2022, several European firms have struggled to challenge Gazprom successfully in court or arbitration. ČEZ’s victory is among the first that has resulted in a **publicly known monetary award**, signaling that **state-linked suppliers are not immune** from commercial accountability.

## Conclusion: Law Over Leverage

In the end, the tribunal’s decision underscores a key principle: **contracts remain binding, even under pressure**. While the war in Ukraine has reshaped Europe’s energy landscape, legal obligations continue to matter — and can be enforced through well-drafted contracts and independent tribunals.

As more disputes arise from the global energy shock, this case sets a precedent: **hard law can still prevail over hard power**. For buyers, sellers, and states alike, it’s a reminder that the rules of international commerce don’t disappear when politics heat up — they just become more vital.
