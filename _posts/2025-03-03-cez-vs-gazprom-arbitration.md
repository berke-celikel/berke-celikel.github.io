## Contracts in the Crossfire: ČEZ’s Legal Victory Over Gazprom

In February 2025, the Czech utility ČEZ secured a €42 million arbitration award against Gazprom Export. The claim stemmed from undelivered gas during the 2022–23 European energy crisis—when supply chains fractured in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But this dispute was not resolved in parliaments or press briefings. It played out before the ICC in Paris, where legal process—not political pressure—decided the outcome (ČEZ, 2025; Reuters, 2025).

## Background: Force Majeure in a Time of War

The case arose under a long-term take-or-pay gas contract. When Gazprom ceased or drastically reduced deliveries to CEZ during the 2022–23 crisis, it invoked force majeure, citing war, sanctions, and alleged regulatory impossibilities (Global Arbitration Review, 2025). CEZ disagreed, arguing that the contractual breaches were not legally excused and incurred substantial losses as it scrambled to procure alternative supply on the volatile spot market.

The matter was referred to arbitration under the rules of the **International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)**, seated in **Paris**, as provided in the parties’ contract (ICC Reporter, 2025).

## When Force Majeure Meets Hard Law

Force majeure is a legal doctrine that excuses a party from liability when an extraordinary event makes performance impossible. However, most clauses require:

1. The event must fall within the definition (e.g., war, sanctions, government action).  
2. It must **directly prevent** contractual performance.  
3. The party must **act in good faith** and attempt to mitigate.  
4. **Proper notice** must be given, with supporting evidence.

In this case, the tribunal found that:
- Gazprom had **not demonstrated** that deliveries to CEZ were legally or physically impossible.
- The company **continued supplying other customers**, weakening its argument that external conditions had truly prevented performance.
- Gazprom failed to **properly notify or document** its force majeure claim in accordance with the contract’s procedures (ICC Reporter, 2025).

Accordingly, the force majeure defence failed.

## The Award: €42 Million for Non-Delivery

The tribunal ruled that Gazprom had breached the contract and was liable for damages. ČEZ was awarded:
- Approximately **CZK 1 billion (€42 million)**,  
- Plus **interest and legal costs** (ČEZ, 2025).

The award was described by ČEZ as a full victory, and the company indicated that it may pursue enforcement actions if Gazprom fails to pay voluntarily (Reuters, 2025).

## Why This Case Matters

### 1. Legal Accountability During Crisis

This ruling affirms that **contract law still governs**, even in exceptional geopolitical circumstances. War and sanctions may alter the legal landscape, but they do not grant parties carte blanche to abandon obligations without due process.

### 2. Testing the Limits of Force Majeure

The award draws an important line: force majeure must be proven, not presumed. The burden is on the claiming party to demonstrate that it had no reasonable means of fulfilling its obligations and that it followed contractual procedures in good faith.

### 3. A Signal to the Energy Sector

As other European utilities consider legal action over interrupted Russian energy supplies, the ČEZ case may serve as a **precedent and a playbook**. It shows that even politically sensitive cases can be resolved through neutral international arbitration.

---

## What Happens Next?

Gazprom has not publicly responded to the ruling. ČEZ may move to enforce the award under the **New York Convention** if payment is withheld. Meanwhile, this outcome is likely to encourage further claims from European buyers who suffered similar disruptions during the crisis (Wikipedia, 2025).

## Conclusion: When Crisis Meets Contract

The CEZ–Gazprom case illustrates that **law can hold firm even when diplomacy and markets falter**. It reminds us that international contracts are more than paper promises—they are legal obligations enforceable across borders. In this instance, arbitration ensured accountability when politics alone could not.
