When Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, it triggered not just a geopolitical crisis, but a commercial one. Among the many European companies left scrambling to secure fuel amid plummeting deliveries was **ČEZ**, the Czech Republic’s state-backed utility.

But unlike others, ČEZ took its supplier—**Gazprom Export**—to arbitration. And in **February 2025**, it won. An **ICC tribunal** awarded ČEZ roughly **$42 million** in damages, holding Gazprom liable for gas deliveries it had failed to supply during the **2022–2023 energy crisis** (Reuters, 2025).

## The Conflict Behind the Contract

At the heart of this dispute was a **long-term gas supply agreement** governed by international law and overseen by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The contract obligated Gazprom to deliver agreed volumes of gas to ČEZ. But during the war, Gazprom significantly curtailed deliveries.

In its defence, Gazprom invoked **force majeure**—arguing that war-related sanctions, logistical barriers, and political instability made performance impossible. Force majeure clauses are common in international contracts. But invoking them successfully requires more than citing a crisis.

---

## Why This Case Mattered

This case raised critical questions:

- Can a seller invoke war as a blanket excuse to halt performance?
- Does economic unviability qualify as force majeure?
- What happens when one party is state-owned and acts under political instruction?

The ICC tribunal, sitting in Switzerland, weighed the contract’s terms, the applicable legal standards, and Gazprom’s obligations. It ruled in **ČEZ’s favour**, finding that Gazprom had **not met the legal threshold** for force majeure (Global Arbitration Review, 2025).

## What Counts as Force Majeure?

The Gazprom case underscores how tribunals interpret **force majeure** in international contracts. Most clauses require four conditions to be met:

**1. The Event Falls Within the Clause**  
The disruption must be explicitly covered by the force majeure provision in the contract. Typical examples include war, embargoes, acts of government, or natural disasters. 

**2. Performance Is Objectively Prevented**  
The event must make it *impossible* (not merely more expensive or commercially impractical) to perform the contractual obligations. A drop in profit or logistical hardship is generally not enough. The standard is often one of physical or legal impossibility.

**3. The Affected Party Acted Diligently**  
Parties invoking force majeure must act in good faith. This includes making reasonable efforts to avoid or overcome the consequences of the event. Passive or opportunistic behavior can undermine the claim.

**4. Timely and Proper Notice Was Given**  
Most clauses require the invoking party to notify the counterparty promptly and in writing, often within a defined time frame. The notice should include details about the event, its impact on performance, and any mitigating actions taken.

In this case, the tribunal concluded that Gazprom’s **arguments were insufficient**. While war is a recognised force majeure event, the **link between the conflict and Gazprom’s non-performance** was deemed **too indirect and inadequately substantiated** (ICC Reporter, 2025). The company also **failed to prove it had explored reasonable alternatives** or taken all steps to minimise disruption.

## Jurisdictional Battle: No Russian Courts Allowed

Another notable aspect of the case was **jurisdiction**. In 2024, ČEZ had obtained a preliminary ruling **barring Gazprom from taking the dispute to Russian courts** (Reuters, 2024). This reinforced the ICC’s authority and prevented parallel litigation in a forum where neutrality could be questioned.

This decision matters: it **reaffirms confidence in international arbitration** and shows how global tribunals can resist pressure from politically influenced domestic courts.

---

## The Award and Its Implications

The tribunal awarded **$42 million in damages**, one of the largest recent rulings against Gazprom. But more than the number, the case set an **important precedent**.

- **War alone isn’t a free pass**: Just because performance becomes harder, even under extreme events, doesn’t mean parties are excused.
- **Commercial and political motives must be separated**: Gazprom is state-linked, but the tribunal treated it as a commercial actor bound by contract.
- **Good faith and procedural discipline matter**: Failing to mitigate losses or notify in time can undermine a party’s force majeure defence.

---

## What This Means for Future Energy Disputes

The ČEZ ruling is likely to reverberate across **European energy markets** and **state contracts**. It serves as a reminder that:

- Arbitration remains a powerful tool for holding powerful suppliers to account—even amid geopolitical disruption.
- Companies should **draft force majeure clauses carefully**, specifying events, obligations, and notice procedures.
- Courts and tribunals are willing to look past politics and focus on **contractual accountability**.

## Conclusion: Crisis is No Contract Killer

This was more than a regional utility challenging a superpower. The ICC case reflects how commercial law remains **resilient under pressure**. It shows that **even in wartime**, agreements can—and must—be honoured unless strict legal standards are met.

In a world increasingly shaped by **conflict, sanctions, and supply shocks**, this case stands as a reminder: **crisis is not carte blanche**. Contracts still speak. And when they don’t, tribunals do.
