On **5 May 2025**, Russian state nuclear energy giant **Rosatom** initiated a $2.8 billion arbitration against Finnish companies **Fortum** and **Outokumpu**, alleging breach of contractual obligations tied to the **Hanhikivi‑1 nuclear power plant** (Reuters, 2025). The plant, a landmark joint venture between Russia and Finland, was part of an ambitious energy cooperation scheme that crumbled in the wake of **Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine** and subsequent **EU sanctions** (NucNet, 2025).

This case, already drawing global attention, brings together the **geopolitics of war**, **transnational contract law**, and **energy security** into one high-stakes arbitration.

## A Nuclear Project Caught in the Crossfire

The **Hanhikivi‑1 project** was no small endeavor. Located in Pyhäjoki, Finland, the nuclear power plant was being developed by **Fennovoima**, a consortium involving Finnish industrial stakeholders and led by Fortum. Rosatom, through its subsidiary RAOS Project Oy, was to supply the **VVER-1200 nuclear reactor**, fund a substantial part of the construction, and provide nuclear fuel (Reuters, 2025).

After years of planning, the project was abruptly **terminated in May 2022**, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The **Finnish Government revoked Rosatom's construction permit**, citing national security concerns and the breakdown of political trust (NucNet, 2025). Fennovoima followed with a formal contract cancellation. Rosatom’s legal response took two years to materialize, culminating in the recent $2.8 billion claim (Reuters, 2025).

## Legal Dimensions: Contracts, Sanctions, and Attribution

### Breach of Contract Allegations

Rosatom’s claim is built on allegations that:
- The cancellation lacked a valid contractual basis;
- Fennovoima acted unilaterally and under political pressure;
- Fortum and Outokumpu, as corporate stakeholders, are liable for lost investment, technical services, and fuel contracts (Reuters, 2025).

Rosatom argues that the Finnish side failed to honor long-term commitments enshrined in the EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) agreement.

### Sanctions as Force Majeure?

Fortum and Fennovoima are expected to argue that the EU sanctions regime and Finnish export controls constituted a **force majeure** event. That is, the performance of contractual duties became legally or physically impossible due to government measures (Guide to NY Convention, 2023).

Under international commercial law, however, **force majeure is not automatically triggered by geopolitical events**:
- The clause must be **explicit** in the contract;
- The event must make performance **impossible**, not just impractical;
- The invoking party must issue **timely notice** and attempt to **mitigate** damage (Guide to NY Convention, 2023).

The tribunal will likely scrutinize whether sanctions merely made the deal politically untenable or genuinely impossible to perform.

## Geopolitical Tensions at the Arbitration Table

This case does not arise in a vacuum. Since 2022, Rosatom has been increasingly **isolated in the European nuclear market**. Finland's severance of ties was part of a broader wave of decoupling from Russian energy infrastructure (NucNet, 2025). This arbitration will test whether state-linked companies can use **commercial law to push back against geopolitical isolation**.

Interestingly, Rosatom has framed its claim not only in contractual terms, but as a defense of the **sanctity of international business**. It alleges that Fortum and Outokumpu succumbed to political expediency over legal obligations (Reuters, 2025).

Meanwhile, Fortum insists it had no choice: the Finnish government’s revocation of key permits made continuation impossible.

## Multiple Jurisdictions, Unclear Forum

While the initial lawsuit was filed in **Moscow**, reports suggest that related arbitration has been or will be launched before the **ICC** or **SCC** (Reuters, 2025). The exact seat of arbitration remains undisclosed, but it will critically affect **enforceability**.

In **Moscow**, Rosatom may obtain a favorable ruling, but **international enforcement will be complicated** due to sanctions and political hostility. Arbitration under ICC or SCC rules with a European seat would offer greater legitimacy but would also expose Rosatom to neutral adjudication.

A **key hearing was scheduled for March 2026**, suggesting a long road ahead.

---

## Can the Award Be Enforced?

Even if Rosatom prevails, enforcement outside Russia will be complex:
- The **New York Convention (1958)** requires courts to enforce foreign arbitral awards unless they breach **Article V** exceptions (public policy, invalid contract, etc.) (Guide to NY Convention, 2023).
- Finnish and EU courts may **refuse enforcement** under the **public policy exception (Art V(2)(b))** due to sanctions against Russia (Guide to NY Convention, 2023).

Rosatom's success thus hinges not only on legal arguments, but also on whether **a tribunal award can translate into money in hostile jurisdictions**.

---

## Why This Case Is More Than Just $2.8 Billion

### A Legal Stress Test for Sanctions Regimes

This dispute may set a **precedent for how force majeure and sanctions interact** in international arbitration. If the tribunal accepts sanctions as a valid excuse, future claims against sanctioned states or entities may fail.

### Minority Shareholder Exposure

Fortum and Outokumpu are not direct EPC signatories. Rosatom’s move to include them in the claim raises questions about the **liability of non-controlling shareholders** in public-private partnerships (Reuters, 2025).

### Energy Sovereignty in Europe

The Hanhikivi‑1 project was a symbol of Europe’s precarious energy interdependence. Its cancellation and resulting litigation mark a **turning point in EU–Russia energy ties**, emphasizing legal disengagement as well as political.

---

## Conclusion: Law, Politics, and Power Plants

Rosatom vs. Fortum & Outokumpu is more than a private commercial dispute. It is a bellwether for the **future of transnational arbitration in an era of fractured geopolitics**. If Rosatom prevails, it may embolden state-linked entities to seek legal redress against Western governments and companies for sanction-induced losses. If it fails, it may solidify a precedent for treating sanctions as legitimate force majeure.

Whatever the outcome, the case promises to become a landmark in the evolution of **international arbitration under geopolitical strain**.
