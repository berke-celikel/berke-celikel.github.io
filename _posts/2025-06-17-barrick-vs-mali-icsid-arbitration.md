On **16 June 2025**, the **Commercial Tribunal of Bamako** placed Barrick Gold’s **Loulo–Gounkoto complex** under **provisional judicial administration**, appointing former Minister **Zoumana Makadji** for a six-month term. This extraordinary measure followed a sequence of state actions—including the **seizure of over 3 metric tonnes of refined gold**, **arrest warrants** targeting Barrick executives, and the **detention of employees**—all arising from a protracted **tax dispute** (AP, 2025; Reuters, 2025a; FT, 2025).

Anticipating escalating interference, Barrick initiated **ICSID arbitration proceedings** in **May 2025** under the dispute resolution provisions of its **Mining Conventions** with Mali. Simultaneously, it submitted a **Request for Provisional Measures** under **Article 47 of the ICSID Convention** and **Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules**, seeking to halt further state intervention and preserve the status quo (Reuters, 2025b; Reuters, 2024).

With the mine excluded from its **2025 production forecast**, the dispute now carries material economic and legal implications, raising questions about **expropriation**, **investor protection**, and the **limits of state regulatory autonomy** in ongoing operations (Reuters, 2025c).

## 1. Background  

Barrick Gold has operated the **Loulo–Gounkoto gold mining complex** in western Mali since 2003 through its subsidiaries under a series of **Mining Conventions** with the Malian state. The mine constitutes one of Mali’s largest gold production sites and contributes approximately **14 per cent of Barrick’s global gold output**, amounting to over **US$1 billion in annual revenue** (Reuters, 2025a; FT, 2025).

In **late 2024**, tensions escalated when the Government of Mali adopted a **revised mining code** and began asserting more direct control over the sector. This culminated in **Malian customs authorities seizing over 3 metric tonnes of refined gold**, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, citing tax irregularities (Reuters, 2024). Simultaneously, the government issued **export bans** and detained **at least four Barrick employees**, triggering both operational paralysis and reputational risk (Reuters, 2025a; Reuters, 2025c).

In **January 2025**, Barrick formally **suspended mining operations** at Loulo–Gounkoto and excluded the mine from its 2025 production forecasts. A **warrant was later issued** for the arrest of Barrick's CEO, further escalating the crisis (Reuters, 2025b).

In **May 2025**, after failed diplomatic engagement, Barrick initiated proceedings before the **International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)**, invoking dispute resolution clauses in its Mining Conventions. Alongside its request for arbitration, Barrick filed a **Request for Provisional Measures**, aimed at halting further state action and safeguarding its investment and personnel (Reuters, 2025b; Reuters, 2025c).

On **16 June 2025**, the **Bamako Commercial Tribunal** appointed a **provisional administrator** to oversee the mine, transferring operational control from Barrick to a court‑designated appointee (AP, 2025). The appointment, made at the request of the Malian government, further intensified the arbitration's stakes and underscored the urgency of the ICSID proceedings.

## 2. Legal Basis for Provisional Measures

Barrick’s claims are premised on the protections afforded under its **Mining Conventions** with Mali, which incorporate guarantees common in investment treaties, including:

- **Fair and equitable treatment (FET)**;
- **Protection against indirect or unlawful expropriation**; and
- **Recourse to ICSID arbitration** under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention).

Under **Article 47 of the ICSID Convention** and **Rule 39 of the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules** (or Rule 47 under the 2022 Rules), ICSID tribunals are empowered to recommend **provisional measures**—binding orders aimed at preserving the parties’ rights while the arbitration is pending.

To justify such measures, claimants typically must demonstrate that:

1. The measure is **urgent**;
2. There is a risk of **irreparable harm** to their procedural or substantive rights; and
3. The request is made **without prejudging the merits** of the dispute.

This standard has been affirmed in numerous ICSID decisions, including:

- *Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24; and  
- *Quiborax S.A. et al. v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2.

In *Quiborax*, for example, the tribunal granted provisional measures to restrain Bolivia from taking criminal actions and seizing assets in a way that would prejudice the arbitration. The tribunal found these acts posed a risk to the **integrity of the arbitral process itself** (ICSID ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 2006).

Similarly, in the case at hand, Barrick contends that **the arrest of its employees**, **the seizure of gold stocks**, and **the court-imposed operational transfer** of its Loulo–Gounkoto complex together constitute a severe and ongoing threat to its rights and the arbitral process.

These acts, Barrick argues, **exceed regulatory action** and amount to **coercive interference** with both the investment and the integrity of the arbitration. As such, it has requested provisional relief from the ICSID tribunal to preserve the status quo pending a final award.

## 3. Sovereign Regulation vs Treaty Obligations  

Mali argues that its actions—ranging from tax enforcement to judicial administration—constitute legitimate exercises of sovereign authority, grounded in its updated mining code and designed to ensure greater national benefit from extractive industries.

However, under customary international law and the jurisprudence of ICSID tribunals, even bona fide regulatory measures may amount to **indirect expropriation** if they substantially deprive a foreign investor of the use, control, or economic benefit of its investment (Tecmed v. Mexico, ICSID ARB(AF)/00/2; LG&E v. Argentina, ICSID ARB/02/1). The critical inquiry is not the formal legality of the measure under domestic law, but its **effect and proportionality** within the treaty framework.

In assessing whether Mali’s actions breach Barrick’s treaty protections, the tribunal will likely examine whether the state’s conduct:

- Pursues a **legitimate public interest** (e.g. tax compliance or national economic security);
- **Respects procedural fairness**, including transparency and access to remedy;
- Avoids **discriminatory or punitive targeting** of the investor;
- Offers **adequate compensation** if expropriatory in effect.

The temporary judicial administration of the Loulo–Gounkoto mine, combined with asset seizure and criminal enforcement, will be evaluated not in isolation, but for their **cumulative effect** on Barrick’s protected rights under the Mining Conventions and applicable bilateral standards of investment protection.

## 4. Human Rights and Employee Detentions  

The detention of several Barrick employees—described by the company as coercive and extraneous to the underlying tax dispute—raises concerns not just of human rights, but of interference with the arbitral process. While ICSID tribunals do not have jurisdiction over national criminal law per se, they may examine whether such measures amount to a **violation of the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard** or **undermine the integrity of the arbitration**.

In *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* (ICSID ARB/05/22, 2008), the tribunal affirmed that state conduct interfering with procedural rights, including harassment or intimidation of corporate representatives, may breach investment protections. More broadly, investor-state tribunals recognize that **arbitrary arrests or state coercion**, even if styled as domestic enforcement, may be treated as **measures contrary to good faith and due process**.

Here, the tribunal will be tasked with assessing whether:
- The detentions serve a **legitimate legal purpose**, or were imposed **to exert pressure** in the dispute;
- The state respected **minimum standards of due process**;
- The conduct materially impaired Barrick’s ability to manage its investment or present its case.

If the tribunal finds the detentions to be unjustified or politically motivated, it may weigh them as aggravating factors in assessing treaty breaches or ordering provisional relief.

## 5. Enforceability and Impact  

If Barrick secures provisional measures or a final award, **Article 54 of the ICSID Convention** obliges Mali to treat the award as binding and enforce it “as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.” ICSID awards are self-executing in member states and do not require exequatur, unlike non-ICSID (ad hoc or UNCITRAL) awards.

However, in practice, enforcement is conditioned on multiple factors:
- **Voluntary compliance** by the host state (Mali), which may be compromised by political tensions or sovereignty assertions;
- **Availability of attachable assets abroad**, as Article 55 preserves domestic laws on sovereign immunity from execution;
- **Third-party state cooperation**, particularly where assets are located in jurisdictions applying restrictive immunity doctrines.

Provisional measures—authorized under **Article 47 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39**—are not directly enforceable in domestic courts but carry **binding effect under ICSID procedure**. In *City Oriente v. Ecuador* (ICSID ARB/06/21), the tribunal reaffirmed that interim orders are not merely hortatory and that disregard may aggravate state liability.

If granted, provisional relief could:
- Bar further gold export or asset transfer;
- Restrain actions affecting mine control;
- Mitigate procedural prejudice during the arbitration.

Ultimately, if Mali resists a final award, Barrick may pursue execution in third states under **ICSID’s enforcement framework**, though subject to **immunity laws and political risk**. This case thus tests not just the effectiveness of provisional protection, but the **credibility of ICSID enforcement in politically volatile contexts**.

It may also shape future doctrine on **how far tribunals will go to shield investments** from judicial or executive interference during proceedings, especially in extractive industries involving significant sovereign interests.

## 6. Strategic and Economic Stakes  

The dispute carries implications well beyond the Loulo–Gounkoto complex. Three dimensions underscore its strategic weight:

### Economic Disruption and Corporate Exposure

Barrick’s exclusion of Loulo–Gounkoto from its 2025 production forecast—citing halted operations, seized stockpiles, and disrupted exports—may reduce the company’s annual output by over 10 per cent, amounting to a projected loss exceeding US$1 billion (Reuters, 2025c). The dispute affects one of Africa’s most productive gold assets and injects volatility into global gold supply chains.

### Investor Confidence and Comparative Risk

Mali’s conduct—asset seizures, arrests, and provisional administration—stands in contrast to more conciliatory outcomes in recent investor–state mining disputes, such as **Resolute Mining v Mali**, which settled amicably prior to ICSID registration. These developments raise concern over Mali’s investment climate and may deter future foreign direct investment (FDI) in West African extractives (AP, 2025; FT, 2025).

### Precedential Value for Treaty Arbitration in Resource Governance

The arbitration may set precedent on:
- The scope of state authority under revised mining codes;
- The limits of **regulatory discretion** under investment treaties;
- How ICSID tribunals balance **economic sovereignty** against treaty protections in **transitional legal systems**.
As African states increasingly recalibrate resource governance through revised codes and renegotiated fiscal regimes, *Barrick v Mali* may be remembered as a watershed case defining how far those states can go without triggering treaty liability.

## 7. What Happens Next?  

The ICSID tribunal is now seized with Barrick’s request for provisional measures. Under **Article 47 of the ICSID Convention** and **Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules**, the tribunal must assess whether the situation meets the threshold for urgent, necessary intervention to preserve the status quo or protect Barrick’s rights pending final determination.

### Pending Determinations

- **Provisional Measures Decision**: If granted, this may restrain Mali from enforcing the provisional administration order, exporting gold stocks, or detaining further personnel. A denial could embolden further state action and intensify the commercial impact.
- **Jurisdictional Challenges**: Mali may file preliminary objections, asserting domestic jurisdiction or arguing treaty inapplicability under evolving mining legislation.
- **Parallel Proceedings**: Barrick will likely pursue **multi-jurisdictional enforcement strategies**, preparing for potential recognition and enforcement under **Article 54 ICSID**, and resistance under public policy exceptions in Mali or third-party jurisdictions.

### Strategic Outlook

Regardless of the tribunal’s initial ruling, the broader arbitration will shape investor expectations for operating in resource-rich yet legally transitional jurisdictions. Observers will closely follow whether:

- The ICSID process proves effective in restraining politically motivated state interference;
- Barrick obtains enforceable legal relief; and
- Mali re-engages diplomatically to de-escalate the dispute and restore investor confidence.

This case may influence treaty drafting, mining code revisions, and corporate risk planning in the extractive sectors across Africa and beyond.

## Conclusion  

*Barrick v Mali* lies at the crossroads of sovereign regulatory power and the international legal obligations owed to foreign investors under treaty commitments. It raises enduring questions: When can a state legitimately recalibrate its control over strategic natural resources, and when does such action cross the threshold into indirect expropriation or denial of justice?

The ICSID tribunal’s approach—particularly its treatment of provisional measures, human rights implications of employee detentions, and the legal framing of Mali’s economic justifications—will set important doctrinal precedent. It will test the boundaries between lawful regulatory autonomy and the international minimum standard of treatment.

For legal practitioners, arbitrators, and policymakers, the outcome will illuminate the scope of protections offered by Mining Conventions and BITs in volatile jurisdictions. It may also signal how far ICSID tribunals are willing to go to safeguard investor rights in cases involving active interference by host states.

In short, this dispute is more than a high-value arbitration—it is a referendum on the resilience of investor–state dispute settlement in an era of resurging state interventionism.
