### My story

Law graduate with a focus on international arbitration, cross-border transactions, and business law, supported by an interdisciplinary foundation in economics. Iâ€™ve worked across jurisdictions in both in-house and law firm settings, drafting and negotiating contracts, conducting legal research, and advising on regulatory compliance. My experience spans commercial, corporate, insurance, and transport law, with growing expertise in dispute resolution and international legal frameworks. 
Multilingual and globally oriented, I bring a practical, research-driven approach to complex legal challenges.
