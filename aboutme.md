## ⚖️ What Drives Me  
I am especially focused on international commercial law, with a strong emphasis on arbitration and cross-border dispute resolution. What drives me is the intellectual and strategic challenge of navigating complex global disputes—and the opportunity to bring clarity, structure, and fairness to high-stakes legal conflicts.

## 🛠️ Experience  
I’ve worked in both private practice and in-house legal teams, gaining hands-on experience in the maritime, insurance, and transport sectors. From assisting with London-seated arbitration to negotiating international contracts, I’ve actively contributed to resolving legal challenges across jurisdictions.

## 🌐 International Mindset  
Fluent in Turkish, German (C2), and English (C1/C2)—and currently learning Spanish—I’m comfortable operating in multilingual, multicultural legal environments. I’ve also participated in international missions and represented firms at global industry events.

## 📚 Approach  
Grounded in both law and economics, I approach legal practice with a research-based, analytical mindset, emphasizing clarity, coherence, and strategic depth.
