subtitle: Who am I?
---
I’m an internationally oriented legal professional specializing in international arbitration, cross-border dispute resolution, and commercial law. My experience spans both private practice and in-house roles, particularly in the maritime, insurance, and transport sectors. I’m skilled in drafting and negotiating international contracts, advising on regulatory compliance, and supporting complex disputes. With a strong foundation in both law and economics, I bring a pragmatic, research-driven approach to global legal challenges. I’m also fluent in multiple languages and comfortable working across jurisdictions.
