## 📍 Background  
Born in Istanbul and living in Germany since 2019, I’ve pursued an academic and professional path that reflects my international outlook and interdisciplinary interests. I studied Law and Economics at top German universities, including LMU Munich, University of Bonn, and University of Cologne.

## ⚖️ What Drives Me  
I’m especially focused on international commercial law, with a growing interest in Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and its role in cross-border dispute resolution. I’m drawn to the complexity of global legal disputes and the unique challenges they pose—particularly when public and private interests intersect across jurisdictions.

## 🛠️ Experience  
I’ve worked in both private practice and in-house legal teams, gaining hands-on experience in the maritime, insurance, and transport sectors. From assisting with London-seated arbitration to negotiating international contracts, I’ve actively contributed to resolving legal challenges across jurisdictions.

## 🌐 International Mindset  
Fluent in Turkish, German (C2), and English (C1/C2)—and currently learning Spanish—I’m comfortable operating in multilingual, multicultural legal environments. I’ve also participated in international missions and represented firms at global industry events.

## 📚 Approach  
Grounded in both law and economics, I approach legal practice with a research-based, analytical mindset, emphasizing clarity, coherence, and strategic depth. Whether drafting arbitration clauses, interpreting regulatory frameworks, or assessing contractual risk, I aim to translate legal theory into effective, real-world solutions.
